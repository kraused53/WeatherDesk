***WeatherDesk***

A simple python project to update my Ubuntu desktop background according to the weather at my current location.

# About

My inspiration for this project came from an old attempt at a weather forecast app that I made a while ago. I was browsing reddit one night and came across a really cool picture that someone took of a city street in the rain. I was thinking about how it would make a cool desktop background, and a light bulb went off! 

...

Unfortunatly, a quick google search told me that I was not by any means the first person to have this idea. But, I really liked the idea and since my weather app idea had stalled I decided it would be a fun project anyway. 

As I was looking through other peoples takle on the project, I came across the [WeatherDesk](https://github.com/bharadwaj-raju/WeatherDesk) project by gihub user bharadwaj-raju. They had a complete set of images based on the videogame [FireWatch](https://www.firewatchgame.com/) that I fell in love with.

I plan on expanding this project to cover more weather scenarios, so I will eventually replace these with a larger set of photos. But, these will always be one of my favorite sets.
